<h3>Context</h3>
Danny seriously loves Japanese food, so at the beginning of 2021, he decided to embark upon a risky venture and opened a cute little restaurant that sells his three favourite foods: sushi, curry, and ramen.
Dannyâ€™s Diner needs your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - it has captured some very basic data from its few months of operation. Still, it has no idea how to use its data to help them run the business.

<h3>Business Objective</h3>
Improving the loyalty program and evaluating its results.

<h3>Business questions</h3>
<ol>
  <h2><li>What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?</li></h2>
  <h3>Thought ProcessðŸ’­</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Discover that customers' IDs and purchase information are in separate tables.</li>
    <li>Join those tables on the common column(product_id).</li>
    <li>Aggregate the results by customer.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>CodeðŸ’»</h3>
  
  ```SQL
  SELECT sales.customer_id, SUM(menu.price) FROM dannys_diner.sales
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
  GROUP BY customer_id 
  ORDER BY customer_id
  ```

  <h2><li>How many days have each customer visited the restaurant?</li></h2>
   <h3>Thought ProcessðŸ’­</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Count visits by counting order dates per customer.r</li>
    <li>Realize that customers could order more than one product.</li>
    <li>Modify the approach by counting <b>unique</b> dates per customer.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>CodeðŸ’»</h3>
      
  ```SQL
  SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT(order_date)) FROM dannys_diner.sales
  GROUP BY customer_id 
  ORDER BY customer_id
  ```

  <h2><li>What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?</li></h2>
    <h3>Thought ProcessðŸ’­</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Define data needed to answer the question: customer IDs and dish name.</li>
    <li>Identify that data exist in separate tables - join them.</li>
    <li>Now the step that took me the most time - formulate a proper question and answer it. How do I extract the earliest order date for each customer? After some research, I discovered the beauty of the <b>RANK</b> and the <b>PARTITION BY</b> function. You can think of them like this: <b>look at each customer</b> like a separate table and then <b>bring order</b> to their orders. Finally, stack the <I>"Imagined tables"</i> onto each other and voilÃ !
      <li>I've also learned that <b>WHERE</b> statement is executed before <b>RANK</b>. Hence I contained <b>RANK</b> within the subquery to make sure it executes before <b>WHERE</b>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>CodeðŸ’»</h3>

  ```SQL
  SELECT product_name, customer_id, order_date FROM 
  (
  SELECT order_date, product_name, customer_id, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) FROM     
  dannys_diner.sales
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
  ) as merged
  WHERE RANK = 1
  ```

  <li><h2>What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?</h2></li>
   <h3>Thought ProcessðŸ’­</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>Join the Sales and the Menu tables to obtain the names of the products ordered.</li>
     <li>Count records grouped by the name of the dish.</li>
   </ul>
  <h3>CodeðŸ’»</h3>
  
  ```SQL
  SELECT COUNT(product_name) AS most_purchased, product_name FROM dannys_diner.sales
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id 
  GROUP BY product_name
  ORDER BY most_purchased DESC
  LIMIT 1
  ```

  <h2><li>Which item was the most popular for each customer?</li></h2>
   <h3>Thought ProcessðŸ’­</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>First, I created a temporary table with the information I needed to answer the question.</li>
    <li>As in the previous question, I needed to find the first element within each group using the <b>RANK</b> function. This time, however, I <b>reversed RANK order</b> so that the most frequent elements are first. "Why?" you might ask. Because the <b>first element has a fixed value of 1, unlike the last element.</b><br>
Think of a scenario where one person buys only ramen and curry and the other person buys ramen, curry and sushi.<br>
For the person <b>no.1</b>, the last element is 2nd.<br>
For the person <b>no.2</b>, the last element would be the 3rd one.<br>
That's why it's easier to address the first element.</li>
    <li>Customer B appears 3 times in the table. It's because all the dishes are equally popular considering him.</li>
  </ul> 
  <h3>CodeðŸ’»</h3>
  
  ```SQL
  WITH temp_tab AS(
  SELECT product_name, customer_id, COUNT(product_name) AS amount FROM dannys_diner.sales
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON menu.product_id = sales.product_id
  GROUP BY customer_id, product_name)
  
  SELECT * FROM(
  SELECT RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY amount DESC), product_name, customer_id, amount FROM temp_tab
  )
  WHERE RANK = 1

  <h2><li>Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?</li></h2>
   <h3>Thought ProcessðŸ’­</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>Thought how to separate orders before and after obtaining a membership.</li>
     <li>Joined the membership table and the sales table and calculated the difference between the membership start date and the order date. If the difference was negative or equal to 0 the transaction was made after obtaining the membership(Or on the same day).</li>
     <li>Ranked the resulting query by the time difference and partitioned by customer(Descending because the value closest to 0 is the earliest one). Also joined the menu table to get products' name.</li>
     <li>Wrapped the previous <b>RANK</b> query into a subquery so that I can extract the records <b>where RANK = 1.</b></li>
   </ul>
   <h3>CodeðŸ’»</h3>
   
   ```SQL
/* JOIN data, select records where join_date - purchase_date <= 0 */
WITH temp_tab AS(
SELECT * FROM (SELECT AGE(join_date) - AGE(order_date) AS time_diff, sales.customer_id, sales.product_id FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.members
ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id)
WHERE time_diff <= make_interval() 
)

SELECT * FROM(
SELECT time_diff, customer_id, product_name, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY time_diff DESC) FROM (
SELECT * FROM temp_tab 
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
ON temp_tab.product_id = menu.product_id
)
)
WHERE rank = 1

  <h2><li>Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?</li></h2>
    <h3>Thought ProcessðŸ’­</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The logic is almost the same as in the previous question. I used the previous query and modified it.</li>
      <li>The only thing that needs adjustment is the comparison part. Instead of a negative difference, I need only a positive one.</li>
      <li>As shown below, one record contains a month and negative days. It can be a bit confusing to read but it can be fixed with the <b>JUSTIFY_INTERVAL</b> function.</li>
    </ul>

  <li>What are the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?</li>
  <li>If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?</li>
  <li>In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customers A and B have at the end of January?</li>
</ol>
