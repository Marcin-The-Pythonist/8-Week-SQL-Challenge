<h3>Context</h3>
Danny seriously loves Japanese food, so at the beginning of 2021, he decided to embark upon a risky venture and opened a cute little restaurant that sells his three favourite foods: sushi, curry, and ramen.
Dannyâ€™s Diner needs your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - it has captured some very basic data from its few months of operation. Still, it has no idea how to use its data to help them run the business.

<h3>Business Objective</h3>
Improving the loyalty program and evaluating its results.

<h3>Business questions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?</li>
  <h3>Thought ProcessðŸ’­</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Discover that customers' IDs and purchase information are in separate tables.</li>
    <li>Join those tables on the common column(product_id).</li>
    <li>Aggregate the results by customer.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>CodeðŸ’»</h3>
  
  ```SQL
  SELECT sales.customer_id, SUM(menu.price) FROM dannys_diner.sales
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
  GROUP BY customer_id 
  ORDER BY customer_id
  ```

  <li>How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?</li>
   <h3>Thought ProcessðŸ’­</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Count visits by counting order dates per customer.r</li>
    <li>Realize that customers could order more than one product.</li>
    <li>Modify the approach by counting <b>unique</b> dates per customer.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>CodeðŸ’»</h3>
      
  ```SQL
  SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT(order_date)) FROM dannys_diner.sales
  GROUP BY customer_id 
  ORDER BY customer_id
  ```

  <li>What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?</li>
    <h3>Thought ProcessðŸ’­</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Define data needed to answer the question: customer IDs and dish name</li>
    <li>Identify that data exist in separate tables - join them</li>
    <li>Now the step that took me the most time - formulate a proper question and answer it. How do I extract the earliest order date for each customer? After some research, I discovered the beauty of the <b>RANK</b> and the <b>PARTITION BY</b> function. You can think of them like this: <b>look at each customer</b> like a separate table and then <b>bring order</b> to their orders. Finally, stack the <I>"Imagined tables"</i> onto each other and voilÃ !
      <li>I've also learned that <b>WHERE</b> statement is executed before <b>RANK</b>. Hence I contained <b>RANK</b> within the subquery to make sure it executes before <b>WHERE</b></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>CodeðŸ’»</h3>

  ```SQL
  SELECT product_name, customer_id FROM 
  (
  SELECT product_name, customer_id, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) FROM dannys_diner.sales
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
  ) as merged
  WHERE RANK = 1
  ```
  <li>What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?</li>
  <li>Which item was the most popular for each customer?</li>
  <li>Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?</li>
  <li>Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?</li>
  <li>What are the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?</li>
  <li>If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?</li>
  <li>In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?</li>
</ol>
